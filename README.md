## About the project

Pretty basic color picker app that you can find literally anywhere. The only difference is that you can create your own palettes with the colors you picked. 
You can organize them, put them in order with the drag and drop functionality and you can save them to reference them later.

Please note that this is an ongoing project as there is always something to improve.
It is mostly optimized for smaller screen sizes as well but why would you try to work with colors on a mobile...?

Here are some ideas that i plan to implement in the future:
- a more reliable database to save palettes
- if we have a database to save palettes we have to have some user authentication/authorization
- since its not a big app, performance optimization is not high priority but some unnecessary re-renders could use a fix
